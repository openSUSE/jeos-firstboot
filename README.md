# jeos-firstboot
## Description
jeos-firstboot allows initial configuration and adjustments of a Linux system using text based dialogs.

It is a lightweight and customisable firstboot wizard that allows to set basic system settings during and after the first boot of an image. Including showing the license and prompt for language, keyboard, timezone, root passsword and network configuration..

This is mainly developed for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server JeOS images. For more information visit the [JeOS wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:JeOS).

## Getting Started
jeos-firstboot can be extended using separate modules, writing a script with the appropriate format and have it installed under `/usr/lib/share/jeos-firstboot/modules` or `/etc/jeos-firstboot/modules` will make this module be executed.
For more information on modules format please check [jeos-firstboot extensions](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:JeOS:Documentation)

### Installation

The RPM package is developed in openSUSE OBS [devel package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:openSUSE:Factory/jeos-firstboot)

You can also get binaries RPM for openSUSE flavours at [package download](https://software.opensuse.org/package/jeos-firstboot)
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

jeos-firstboot is used as two systemd services [jeos-firstboot.service](https://github.com/openSUSE/jeos-firstboot/blob/master/files/usr/lib/systemd/system/jeos-firstboot.service) and [jeos-firstboot-snapshot](https://github.com/openSUSE/jeos-firstboot/blob/master/files/usr/lib/systemd/system/jeos-firstboot-snapshot.service), for using it you need to copy the appropriate service files and enable it.

You can check the example in the RPM package for installation.

The service is controlled by a file, so after installing it you should be sure that your system is configured appropriately

```sh
# Enable jeos-firstboot
mkdir -p /var/lib/YaST2
touch /var/lib/YaST2/reconfig_system

systemctl mask systemd-firstboot.service
systemctl enable jeos-firstboot.service
```
Beside the service that runs on firstboot there is also a tool to change configuration in a running system, this will also be installed and available as `jeos-config`

jeos-config usage:
```
Usage: jeos-config [OPTION...] [CONFIG_NAME]
Configure system settings using an interactive dialog

	-h              shows this usage help
	locale          Show configuration for locale
	keytable        Show configuration for keyboard
	timezone        Show configuration for timezone
	password        Show configuration for password
	network         Show configuration for network
	raspberrywifi   Show configuration for raspberrywifi
```     
Additional modules (like raspberrywifi) are shown if present.

If no parameter is given it shows a dialog for selection.
